## What else can litsearchr do?
litsearchr can do more than help with keyword harvesting and Boolean search construction. You can also use litsearchr to test the performance of your search strategy. To do this, you would generate a list of benchmark articles. These can be imported into litsearchr and then compared against the results of your search strategy run and exported from a database. Litsearchr can provide precision and recall information and a list of benchmark studies not found with your search.

To learn more about how to use litsearchr for this purpose, you can work through [the Library Carpentry episode](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/lc-litsearchr/17-test-a-search-strategy-with-litsearchr/index.html) on this topic. 

## More help with litsearchr
To keep learning more about litsearchr, we recommend working through [litsearchr's vignette[(https://elizagrames.github.io/litsearchr/litsearchr_vignette.html) and [this useful tutorial](https://luketudge.github.io/litsearchr-tutorial/litsearchr_tutorial.html) by Luke Tudge.

Finally, you can always use the [litsearchr Shiny app](https://elizagrames.shinyapps.io/litsearchr/), which provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to use litsearchr without any coding necessary. Note that not all functions and features of litsearchr are available through the GUI, but most of the necessary functionality is available including many of the parameter settings.
