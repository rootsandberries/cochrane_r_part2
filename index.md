# Demystifying R Part 2: An introduction to coding in R and RStudio
## Cochrane Colloquium 2023, London, UK

Tools like R and Python are becoming increasingly useful in the conduct of systematic reviews and evidence synthesis. In R specifically, many tools have been developed specifically to facilitate the systematic review process. Some of these tools provide vignettes and examples to help novice coders make use of the tools in a coding environment like RStudio, and others have graphical user interfaces that make them accessible to users without coding experience. One such tool is litsearchr, an R package that supports term harvesting, Boolean search construction, and search strategy testing, among other steps. This workshop will introduce learners to the basics of the R coding language and the RStudio coding environment, in the context of litsearchr and evidence synthesis work. We will draw from recently developed [Library Carpentry curriculum](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/lc-litsearchr/). This workshop is geared towards participants with no coding experience. Participants will learn basic concepts of working with files, folders and objects in R and RStudio, will understand different data structures, and will be introduced to litsearchr as a tool that can be incorporated into their systematic review workflows.

## Library Carpentry

[Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.org) is a software and data skills training programme for people working in library- and information-related roles. It builds on the work of [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/). Library Carpentry is an official Lesson Program of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
